### Introduction
This repository merges two similar repositories:
* __[crypto-simulations](https://github.com/cartercarlson/crypto-simulations)__
  * Simulates rebalancing a randomly selected basket of 5 coins 250 times and records the total value of the portfolio
    over the course of the simulation.
  * Compares overall hodl performance to rebalanced performance.
* __[transaction-log](https://github.com/cartercarlson/transaction-log)__
  * Rebalances a specific basket of coins and captures details of the transactions
  * Can be simulated or used for personal rebalancing
  
### Project Goals
* React front end
* Display coin transactions and summaries in a clean, easy to understand
format
* Functional product to rebalance personal funds or simulate rebalance
* Allow users to select which coins/dates they want to simulate
