Rebalancing upgrades & ideas:
  specify which asset want to rebalance to, by having them in txt file, or on website fields. THis will make adding/dropping an asset much easier, and initial setup much, much better.

  introduce a multiplier for each asset, that will be used to determine % of asset, based on specific factors. The multipliers for each asset are added up, then divide each assets # by total, to find current % of each asset to own.

  track each assets average volatility range, when the price goes lower/higher, would increase/decrease multiplier, and trigger a buy/sell. If only buy/sell at specific time each day, the pumps will often be missed. This would require another bucket (wording) that would be held in USDT/BTC, and would be used to rebuy the same asset, when the pump ends, and price returns/rebounds.

  When the price is above 200 MA, multiplier is increased- or even when price is below 200 MA, multiplier is 0 or negative (if going to introduce shorting)

  Use the 4, 9 and 18 MA's. When 4 is above 9, multiply buy 2, when 9 is above 18, multiply by 3.... or something like that.

  look at average daily volume for all coins - when the average daily volume doubles- look at the coin and maybe buy it- something is probaly going on, and some people that know about it are accumulating
